### 📘 Day 1: Introduction to Observability – Detailed Notes

---

#### 🔍 **Core Concepts**

* **Observability**

  * Definition: Ability to understand the internal state of a system from its external outputs.
  * Combines **metrics**, **logs**, and **traces** for a holistic view.
  * Enables proactive debugging and system health analysis.
  * Essential in complex, distributed systems (e.g., Kubernetes, microservices).

* **Monitoring**

  * Focuses on predefined metrics and thresholds.
  * Detects symptoms (e.g., high CPU, memory usage).
  * Used for alerting and dashboarding.
  * Reactive in nature.

* **Logging**

  * Captures detailed, time-stamped event records.
  * Helps trace what happened before/after a failure.
  * Stored in centralized systems for querying and analysis.

* **Tracing**

  * Visualizes the path of requests across multiple services.
  * Key for understanding latency, bottlenecks, and root cause.
  * Tracks request flow using spans and trace IDs.
  * Enables end-to-end visibility in microservice architectures.

#### ⚖️ **Monitoring vs. Observability**

| Aspect  | Monitoring              | Observability                  |
| ------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Nature  | Reactive                | Proactive                      |
| Focus   | Metrics & health status | Logs, metrics, and traces      |
| Usage   | Alerts & status checks  | Root cause analysis, debugging |
| Example | “CPU is 95%”            | “Why is service latency high?” |

#### 🛠️ **Common Tools**

* **Monitoring Tools**

  * Prometheus (open-source, widely used with Kubernetes)
  * Datadog (cloud-native monitoring)
  * New Relic (full-stack observability)
  * Nagios (legacy infrastructure monitoring)

* **Logging Tools**

  * **EFK Stack**

    * Elasticsearch (log storage and search)
    * Fluentbit/Fluentd (log collection and forwarding)
    * Kibana (visualization)
  * Loki (Grafana’s log aggregation system)

* **Tracing Tools**

  * Jaeger (CNCF project, popular with Kubernetes)
  * Zipkin (lightweight tracing system)
  * OpenTelemetry (standard for instrumentation & collection)

#### 🔁 **Bare-Metal vs. Kubernetes Observability**

| Aspect            | Bare Metal                                 | Kubernetes                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Metric Collection | OS-level agents (e.g., collectd, Telegraf) | Kubernetes metrics-server, cAdvisor             |
| Logging           | Syslog, rsyslog, Fluentd                   | Sidecars, DaemonSets (Fluentbit/Fluentd)        |
| Tracing           | Less dynamic environments                  | Needs service mesh or OpenTelemetry             |
| Monitoring Issues | Static, persistent environments            | Dynamic scaling, ephemeral pods, short lifespan |

#### 🧠 **Key Learning Points**

* Observability is the superset of monitoring; it gives deeper insights into **why** something is happening.
* Critical for debugging **modern cloud-native apps**, where systems are distributed, dynamic, and loosely coupled.
* Combining metrics, logs, and traces provides **context-rich** debugging and better Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR).
* Tools like Prometheus, Jaeger, and EFK/Loki are core components in Kubernetes observability stacks.

Here are **interview** and **scenario-based questions** from **Day 1: Introduction to Observability** to help with both theoretical understanding and real-world applications:

### 🎯 **Interview Questions: Observability Basics**

#### 📌 *Fundamental/Basic Questions*

1. **What is the difference between monitoring and observability?**
2. **Why is observability important in distributed systems?**
3. **What are the three pillars of observability? Explain each briefly.**
4. **Name some common tools used for monitoring, logging, and tracing.**
5. **How does tracing help in debugging microservices?**
6. **What is the difference between logs and metrics?**
7. **What role does Fluentbit or Fluentd play in an observability stack?**
8. **What is a service mesh and how does it aid observability?**
9. **Explain how Prometheus collects metrics in a Kubernetes environment.**
10. **What is OpenTelemetry and why is it important?**

### 🧩 **Scenario-Based Questions**

#### ✅ *Scenario 1: Debugging High Latency*

> **Your frontend service is showing increased response times. How would you use observability tools to identify the root cause?**

**Expected Approach:**

* Check **Prometheus** dashboards for CPU/memory/network metrics.
* Use **tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin)** to trace request path and identify bottleneck.
* Use **logs (Loki/EFK)** to identify errors, timeouts, or retries in services.
* Narrow down to specific services causing delays.

---

#### ✅ *Scenario 2: Logs Not Showing Up in Dashboard*

> **You configured Fluentbit to forward logs to Elasticsearch, but logs are not visible in Kibana. How would you troubleshoot this?**

**Expected Approach:**

* Check Fluentbit pod logs for errors.
* Validate output plugin configuration (Elasticsearch endpoint, credentials).
* Check if index is created in Elasticsearch.
* Confirm Kibana is pointed to the right index pattern.

---

#### ✅ *Scenario 3: High Pod Restarts in Kubernetes*

> **You observe frequent pod restarts. What observability signals would you check to understand the issue?**

**Expected Approach:**

* **Metrics**: Check node and pod-level CPU/memory from Prometheus.
* **Logs**: Check container logs (e.g., OOMKilled, CrashLoopBackOff errors).
* **Events**: Use `kubectl describe pod` for lifecycle issues.
* Optionally, check traces if restarts are linked to failed upstream calls.

---

#### ✅ *Scenario 4: Observability in a New Microservice Deployment*

> **You are deploying a new microservice in Kubernetes. What observability components would you ensure are in place from day one?**

**Expected Approach:**

* Metrics: Expose Prometheus-compatible metrics using `/metrics` endpoint.
* Logging: Configure Fluentbit sidecar or DaemonSet to collect logs.
* Tracing: Instrument code with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing.
* Alerts/Dashboards: Set up Grafana for visualization and alerts.

---

#### ✅ *Scenario 5: Comparing Observability in VM vs. Kubernetes*

> **Your team is moving from bare-metal VMs to Kubernetes. What changes in observability strategy would you recommend?**

**Expected Points:**

* Replace host-based metric agents with Prometheus + cAdvisor.
* Use DaemonSets for log collection (e.g., Fluentbit).
* Add tracing with OpenTelemetry and Jaeger for microservices.
* Handle ephemeral pod lifecycle (set proper retention, labels for logs/metrics).
* Use service discovery in Prometheus instead of static configs.
