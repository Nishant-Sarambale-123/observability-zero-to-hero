Here’s a full **Interview Prep + Real-World Scenario Guide** for **Day 6: Distributed Tracing with Jaeger**—tailored to microservices, Kubernetes, and observability interviews:

---

## ✅ **Day 6: Distributed Tracing with Jaeger**

---

### 📘 **Key Concepts**

#### 🔍 **What is Distributed Tracing?**

* Technique to **trace a request's path** across multiple services/microservices.
* Each unit of work is called a **span**; multiple spans form a **trace**.
* Helps identify:

  * **Performance bottlenecks**
  * **Inter-service failures**
  * **Latency hotspots**

---

### 🏗️ **Jaeger Architecture**

| Component           | Role                                                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent**           | Collects spans from apps (runs as sidecar/daemonset) |
| **Collector**       | Aggregates spans from agents and stores them         |
| **Query/UI**        | Visualizes traces in a timeline view                 |
| **Storage Backend** | Default: in-memory; can use Elasticsearch, Cassandra |

---

### ⚙️ **Jaeger Setup via Helm**

```bash
helm repo add jaegertracing https://jaegertracing.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install jaeger jaegertracing/jaeger
```

* This deploys the full Jaeger stack into Kubernetes
* Jaeger UI will be accessible via `NodePort` or Ingress

---

### 🧪 **Instrumentation using OpenTelemetry**

Use **OpenTelemetry SDK** to create spans in application code.

**Example (Node.js / Python / Go):**

```js
const tracer = opentelemetry.trace.getTracer("auth-service");
const span = tracer.startSpan("db_query");
span.end();
```

* Add metadata (tags, logs, parent-child relationships)
* Context propagation is key across services (e.g., HTTP headers)

---

### 🖼️ **Jaeger UI Highlights**

* View **complete trace timeline**
* Drill into each **span** with metadata
* See **latency breakdown** across services
* Identify where time is spent (e.g., DB, API calls)

---

## 🧠 **Key Learning Outcomes**

* Implement **trace instrumentation** in microservices.
* Use **Jaeger UI** to visualize request flows and debug slow operations.
* Understand how spans and context propagation work across service boundaries.

---

## 🎯 **Interview Questions & Answers**

---

### 🔹 **Basic**

#### 1. **What is distributed tracing and why is it important?**

**Answer**:
Distributed tracing tracks a request as it flows across microservices. It’s essential for debugging performance issues and identifying failures across service boundaries in distributed systems.

---

#### 2. **What are spans and traces?**

**Answer**:

* A **span** is a single unit of work (e.g., an HTTP request, DB call)
* A **trace** is a collection of spans representing the entire request lifecycle

---

#### 3. **What are the core components of Jaeger?**

**Answer**:

* **Agent**: Collects spans from instrumented services
* **Collector**: Processes and stores span data
* **Query/UI**: Frontend to visualize and query traces
* **Storage**: Backend for trace storage (in-memory, Elasticsearch, etc.)

---

### 🔹 **Intermediate**

#### 4. **How does context propagation work in distributed tracing?**

**Answer**:
Context propagation involves passing trace context (trace ID, span ID) between services, usually through **HTTP headers** (e.g., `traceparent`, `baggage`). This ensures all spans are linked into a single trace.

---

#### 5. **How do you instrument your code to generate spans?**

**Answer**:

* Use an OpenTelemetry SDK (or Jaeger client)
* Get a tracer and start a span:

```python
with tracer.start_as_current_span("checkout-operation"):
    # your business logic here
```

---

#### 6. **How would you deploy Jaeger in Kubernetes?**

**Answer**:

```bash
helm install jaeger jaegertracing/jaeger
```

This installs all required components. Then expose the UI via `kubectl port-forward` or Ingress.

---

## 📘 **Real-World Scenario-Based Questions**

---

### 🔸 **Scenario 1: Your microservices-based app has slow responses, but metrics look normal. What do you do?**

**Answer**:

* Add distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry SDK.
* Trace a slow request in Jaeger to identify where the latency occurs (e.g., DB call, downstream API).
* Add custom tags to highlight specific operations or timeouts.

---

### 🔸 **Scenario 2: One of your services is timing out under load. How would you debug this using Jaeger?**

**Answer**:

* Use Jaeger UI to find traces with long durations.
* Check span durations per service.
* Look for delays in inter-service communication or retries.
* Investigate if downstream services (e.g., DB, cache) are contributing to latency.

---

### 🔸 **Scenario 3: You want to understand how a request moves across your services. What would you do?**

**Answer**:

* Use tracing instrumentation to create spans at entry and exit points.
* Use **context propagation** to pass trace context (headers).
* View the full trace timeline in Jaeger.

---

### 🔸 **Scenario 4: How do you identify performance bottlenecks in microservices?**

**Answer**:

* Use tracing to visualize which span has the **longest duration**.
* Use Jaeger tags/logs to identify slow DB queries or network calls.
* Combine tracing with metrics (e.g., Prometheus) for deeper insights.

Sure! Here are **focused interview Q\&A** and **real-world scenarios** based on **Day 6: Distributed Tracing with Jaeger**:

---

## ✅ **Jaeger – Interview Questions and Answers**

---

### 🔹 **Q1. What is Distributed Tracing? Why is it needed?**

**Answer**:
Distributed tracing tracks the **lifecycle of a request** across multiple services in a microservices architecture. It helps:

* Understand service-to-service communication
* Pinpoint **latency bottlenecks**
* Debug failures in **inter-service** flows

---

### 🔹 **Q2. What are “Spans” and “Traces” in Jaeger?**

**Answer**:

* A **Span** represents a unit of work (e.g., a DB call, external API call).
* A **Trace** is a collection of spans representing the **end-to-end journey** of a request.

---

### 🔹 **Q3. What are the main components of Jaeger?**

**Answer**:

| Component     | Function                                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent**     | Collects spans from services                  |
| **Collector** | Processes and stores spans                    |
| **Query/UI**  | Lets users search and view traces             |
| **Storage**   | Stores spans (e.g., Elasticsearch, Cassandra) |

---

### 🔹 **Q4. How do you instrument a service for tracing?**

**Answer**:
Using **OpenTelemetry SDK**:

```js
const tracer = opentelemetry.trace.getTracer('my-service');
const span = tracer.startSpan('db_query');
// do something
span.end();
```

This span will be sent to Jaeger for visualization.

---

### 🔹 **Q5. What is Context Propagation?**

**Answer**:
Context propagation ensures the **trace ID and span context** are passed between services via headers (e.g., `traceparent`). It connects spans across services into one trace.

---

## 🔍 **Scenario-Based Questions**

---

### 🔸 **Scenario 1:**

**You’re working on a microservices app. The frontend reports slow response times, but CPU and memory metrics are normal. What would you do?**

**Answer**:

* Implement **distributed tracing** using OpenTelemetry.
* Send traces to **Jaeger** to visualize how the request flows across services.
* Use **Jaeger UI** to identify which service or span is taking the most time (e.g., slow DB query or API call).
* Use that insight to optimize only the slow portion.

---

### 🔸 **Scenario 2:**

**You see intermittent timeouts between `service-A` and `service-B`. Logs are insufficient. How can you debug this?**

**Answer**:

* Add instrumentation in both services using tracing.
* Ensure **context propagation** is properly configured (pass headers).
* Check Jaeger UI for traces that include both services.
* Look for:

  * Long span durations
  * Retry behavior
  * Gaps in the trace (could mean dropped spans or instrumentation gaps)

---

### 🔸 **Scenario 3:**

**After a deployment, latency increases. How do you correlate deployment with degraded performance?**

**Answer**:

* Look at **Jaeger traces** before and after the deployment.
* Compare span durations and check if a new code path is slower.
* Use tracing metadata (tags or deployment version labels) to filter by release.
* Trace can reveal new external dependency or slow internal call introduced in the new build.

* A specific **instrumentation example** in Node.js, Python, or Java?
* A **Jaeger Helm setup YAML**?
